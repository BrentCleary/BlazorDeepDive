Blazor Server Application Notes - 08-02-25

LESSON 4

app.Run() - This runs the application in a loop, listening for httpRequests coming in


app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UserStaticFiles();
app.UseAntiforgery();

app.MapRazorComponents<App>();

When an httprequest comes in, these functions (called middleware) add things to the request or handles the request with certain functionality


app.MapRazorComponents<App>(); - This maps the HTTP request to the <App> Class


App.razor is a plain html page, except that it has a 
<Routes /> 	   Component
<HeadOutlet /> Component


All Requests that come into the app are routed to the <App> Class component.
It is the Root component of the application
This is the "Single Page" of the Single Page Framework of Blazor

This page now uses the 
<Routes /> component
To find corresponding components, and place them in the <App>.razor body


Routes.razor hols the <Router> Component
The <Router> Component finds the Component you have requested and applies the Master Layout, which produces a final HTML Result, and returns it to the App.Razor


***** ----- .razor means any file this extension is a razor component ----- *****

PROCESS ROUTE

HTTPS Request Mapped to App.razor
App.Razor HTML calls Routes.Razor
Routes.Razor uses <Router> Component to find the requested Component ("Weather", "Other")
	Applies MainLayout to the Page Component
	Component fills in the @Body part of the MainLayout
This is returned to the App.Razor component and displayed

LESSON 6: Two Types of Components

Two Types of Components

	- Routable Component - This component acts like page.
		These components can be located by the <Router /> component and palced in the Root Component (App.razor)
		The single most important thing making a Component Routable
			@page "/servers" directive is on the top


	- Non-Routable Component (Reusable Component)
		Can be used inside of each Routable component
		Can be used inside of other Non-Routable Components

		These will be called "Controls" and stored in the Controls folder in this course


	- _Layout.razor - This is the application wide @using reference. Placing the folder directory in this will allow all apps to access the contained components without referencing the entire namespace or importing the using reference on each page or component.
